# Parallel Steps

Four runnable Flow examples cover the common parallel Step shapes:

- `StaticParallelStepsFlow` starts `WorkAStep` and `WorkBStep`.
- `DynamicParallelStepsFlow` creates N `DoWorkStep` executions at runtime.
- `AwaitParallelStepsFlow` waits for one `complete_ch` message from every worker.
- `FirstWinParallelStepsFlow` keeps the first result and cancels sibling workers.

The dynamic workers use short random delays so completion order, waiting, and
first-win cancellation are visible.
