# Dex Python examples

These examples target the published Dex Python SDK version pinned in
[`pyproject.toml`](./pyproject.toml)
(`import dex`). Requires Python 3.11+.

The primary sample process hosts one asyncio `AsyncWorker` on `127.0.0.1:8803` and a
Quart HTTP controller on `127.0.0.1:8080`. Controllers and nested parent/child Steps
use `AsyncClient`. One Registry and disk BlobCache are shared by Worker and Client.

For the sync `Client` / `Worker` surface (Flask), see [`sync-python/`](./sync-python/).

## Layout

```
dex_examples/
├── products/       # real-world business scenarios
├── patterns/       # design patterns
├── primitives/     # one minimal example per Dex primitive
├── shared/         # mock services and HTTP helpers
├── app.py          # Worker registry
└── http_app.py     # Quart blueprint assembly
```

HTTP routes use category prefixes:

- `/products/<kebab>/...` — e.g. `/products/job-post/create`
- `/patterns/<kebab>/...` — e.g. `/patterns/polling/start/simple`
- `/primitives/<kebab>/...` — e.g. `/primitives/channel/approve`

## Run locally

```bash
dexcli dev
uv sync --locked
uv run --frozen python main.py
```

Defaults connect to Dex at `localhost:8801`. Override with
`DEX_FLOW_SERVICE_ADDRESS`, `DEX_WORKER_BIND_ADDRESS`, `DEX_WORKER_TARGET`,
`DEX_EXAMPLES_HTTP_ADDRESS`, `DEX_BLOB_CACHE_DIR`.

## Verify

```bash
make unitTests
make e2eTests
```

The Go examples support `./run-e2e-tests.sh --keep-running` to leave Dex running
after E2E tests for manual HTTP exploration.

## Patterns

Under [`dex_examples/patterns/`](./dex_examples/patterns/), including
[Cron schedule](./dex_examples/patterns/cron),

and others.

## Primitives

Seven minimal examples under [`dex_examples/primitives/`](./dex_examples/primitives/):
step, attribute, channel, timer, rpc, subflow, and client-apis.
