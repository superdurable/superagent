# AI Agent

This Python application is a general durable AI Agent. Dex owns its conversation
state, plans, tool queue, approvals, context summaries, and timers. LiteLLM
provides the model adapter, while the official MCP Python SDK connects trusted
local or remote tool servers.

The application runs without external credentials by default with the `mock/dex`
model. Its local model echoes normal messages and understands `/wait <seconds>
<reason>`, which makes the durable timer easy to test.

## Architecture

- `AgentMessages` is an AttributeMap. Each value stores one message and its creation time.
- `AgentPlan` atomically stores the current revision and ordered task list.
- `ContextSummary` keeps the cumulative compaction summary.
- `QueuedUserMessages` keeps user messages in a durable FIFO queue.
- `SteeredUserMessages` carries explicit Steer messages to safe boundaries.
- Other Channels carry plan execution requests and tool approvals.
- `ReasoningSummary` uses a buffered text writer for OpenAI reasoning summaries.
- `AssistantText` uses a separate buffered writer for visible response text.
- `AgentActivity` is a best-effort Stream for tool and lifecycle progress.
- The `durable_wait` tool uses a Dex Timer and can be interrupted by Steer.
- Write, destructive, and unclassified MCP tools wait for explicit approval.

The current AttributeMap retains 2,000 messages by default. Dex compacts older
context before deleting summarized map instances. Deleted instances remain in the
Flow history until the configured history retention expires.

The model adapter receives separate buffered callbacks for reasoning summaries
and assistant text. The SDK combines token-sized chunks for up to one second or
16 KiB and flushes each final batch when the Step invocation finishes.

OpenAI models use LiteLLM's Responses API adapter with stateless requests and an
automatic reasoning summary. Dex still rebuilds the complete provider-neutral
input for every call. Encrypted OpenAI reasoning items are retained with their
durable assistant message and replayed when that provider requires them. The UI labels official reasoning-summary events as
**Thinking**, visible output as **Response**, and structured tool or lifecycle
events as **Agent activity**. Providers without reasoning-summary events never
show inferred or fabricated thinking.

## Plan before execution

Enable **Plan mode** beside the message composer to create or revise a plan. The
Agent can only call `write_todos` during that turn. MCP tools and the durable timer
remain unavailable until the user clicks **Execute plan**.

The plan card survives page refreshes and Worker restarts. It shows pending, in
progress, and completed tasks. If the model stops with unfinished work, the card
remains active and offers **Continue plan**. A waiting Agent is not necessarily a
completed plan.

## Queue and Steer

Submitting while the Agent loop is active adds a visible **Queued** message. The
Agent does not consume it until the loop returns to **AwaitUser**. Before then,
the UI can edit it, delete it, or choose **Steer**. Editing first deletes the
pending message and puts its content back in the composer; submitting it again
creates a new message at the queue tail.

Steer uses a transactional RPC to delete the selected queued message and publish
the same value to **SteeredUserMessages**. Dex applies it before the next model
call, tool, approval wait, or Timer continuation. It does not cancel an LLM or MCP
request already running. A Steer clears unexecuted tool calls and records durable
cancellation results. Only Steer interrupts a tool approval or durable wait.

The queue panel remains above the composer. It collapses to a compact status row
when both queues are empty and expands automatically when a pending message appears.
The browser page is the conversation scroll surface. The queue, user-input request,
and composer stay fixed at the bottom while new activity remains visible above them.
The UI treats the Server queue as canonical. It keeps a submitted item visible
until the Server reports it as pending or the Flow consumes it into history. It
refreshes immediately after each mutation, refreshes from Agent activity events
and browser reconnection, and uses an eight-second fallback poll while the page
is visible or the Agent is active.

## Run locally

Start Dex, install the Python dependencies, and build the React application:

```bash
dexcli dev
cd examples/python
uv sync --locked
cd ai-agent
npm ci
npm run build
cd ..
export DEX_AGENT_MCP_CONFIG="$PWD/ai-agent/mcp-servers.local.yaml"
uv run --frozen python main.py
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:8080/products/ai-agent/](http://127.0.0.1:8080/products/ai-agent/).
The first page is the Agent Portal. Choose a configured LiteLLM provider and
model, then select the registered MCP servers and tools available to the new
session. Providers without their required Worker environment variable remain
visible but cannot be selected.

The local MCP configuration starts credential-free search, Slack, and Google
Docs demo servers before the Portal loads. Read operations run automatically.
Demo Slack posts and Google Doc creation still require approval. Use
[`mcp-servers.example.yaml`](./mcp-servers.example.yaml) when connecting real
providers.

The chat page shows reasoning summaries when the provider supplies them and
buffers visible response text separately while a model call is running. Press
**Command/Ctrl+Enter** or **Alt+Enter** to send; plain Enter inserts a line break.
When work needs information that is missing, the Agent uses
**request_user_input** to expand a durable input panel in the conversation and
wait for a reply. The tool may provide known choices, which the UI renders as
selection buttons; otherwise the panel renders a free-form text box.

## Configure a real model

Add the provider credential required by LiteLLM to `examples/.env`:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY="..."
```

Restart the Python examples after changing the file. The Portal shows every
supported provider, but providers without their environment variable are disabled.
It never sends credentials to the browser. Shell environment variables take
precedence over values in `examples/.env`. The selected credential is used for
normal and context-compaction model calls and is never stored in a Dex Attribute,
message, or Flow history.

Worker defaults:

- `DEX_AGENT_MODEL`
- `DEX_AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT`
- `DEX_AGENT_CONTEXT_TOKENS`
- `DEX_AGENT_MESSAGE_RETENTION`
- `DEX_AGENT_MCP_CONFIG`

## Configure MCP servers

Copy [`mcp-servers.example.yaml`](./mcp-servers.example.yaml), edit the trusted
servers, and point the Worker at it:

```bash
export BRAVE_API_KEY="..."
export SLACK_MCP_AUTHORIZATION="Bearer ..."
export GOOGLE_DOCS_MCP_AUTHORIZATION="Bearer ..."
export DEX_AGENT_MCP_CONFIG="$PWD/ai-agent/mcp-servers.yaml"
```

The Brave entry uses the actively maintained
[`@brave/brave-search-mcp-server`](https://github.com/brave/brave-search-mcp-server).
The Slack and Google Docs entries are transport examples: replace their URLs with
servers selected from the [official MCP Registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/).

Configuration keys:

- `transport`: `stdio` or `streamable_http`.
- `env`: child-process variable to Worker environment-variable name.
- `headers`: HTTP header to Worker environment-variable name.
- `trust_read_only_annotations`: allows trusted server annotations to classify a
  tool as read-only.
- `tools`: local read-only classification plus timeout and retry overrides.

MCP sampling, elicitation, and roots are not enabled. Resources, resource
templates, and prompts are exposed through model-visible broker tools.

## Try durable behavior

With `mock/dex`, send:

```text
/wait 12 remind me to check the ticket sale
```

Refresh the page while it waits. The Timer remains active. Send another message
before it fires, then choose **Steer** to interrupt the wait and let the Agent
replan.
