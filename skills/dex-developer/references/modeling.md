# Flow modeling

Use this guide before implementing a non-trivial Flow or when a Flow has become difficult to reason about.

## Find the Flow boundary

A Flow should represent one durable business execution with a stable identity and lifecycle, such as an order, subscription, transfer, approval, or processing job.

Prefer a SubFlow when work needs its own identity, lifecycle, retry boundary, independent scaling, or bounded fan-out. Prefer another Step when the work is only the next state in the same business execution.

## Turn the business process into a Step graph

For each Step, record:

- typed input
- Conditions returned by **WaitFor**
- side effects performed by **Execute**
- Attribute and Channel reads or writes
- retry and timeout policy
- success transition
- exhausted-retry or business-failure transition

Use stable domain names. A Step type is part of the durable contract of open executions, not merely a function name.

## Separate waiting from work

**WaitFor** declares when a Step may execute. It may prepare durable state needed to establish that wait. Do not call third-party services or perform irreversible side effects there.

**Execute** performs application work and returns the next movement or terminal decision. Make external operations idempotent when Dex may retry the Step.

## Persist only durable coordination state

Use Attributes for state that later Steps, RPCs, Clients, search, or recovery need. Large size alone does not require a separate application store: Dex can keep large values as blobs and hydrate them through the SDK BlobCache. Read [large-attributes-and-locality.md](large-attributes-and-locality.md) before designing another blob or cache layer.

Keep authoritative long-lived business records in the application's database when their lifetime exceeds the Flow or they need relational querying, independent pagination, cross-Flow access, analytics, or retention policies that differ from the Flow.

Use Indexed Attributes for bounded lookup and operational search. Use Attribute Store sync when an application-owned database needs a durable projection.

Do not use Channels as generic storage. A Channel message is consumed by a matching wait. Use Attributes for current state and Channels for ordered durable messages.

## Make failure behavior part of the graph

For every external side effect, decide:

- which failures are retryable
- total retry budget and backoff
- whether the operation needs heartbeat/progress reporting
- what happens after retry exhaustion
- whether compensation is required
- whether an operator can recover the Flow
- what deadline ends the business process

Represent compensation and operator recovery as explicit Steps. Do not catch every error and silently mark the Flow successful.

## Design for open executions

Running Flows can outlive a deployment. Prefer additive changes:

- add new Step types instead of changing incompatible behavior in an existing type
- add optional Attributes and RPCs
- retain old Step implementations while open executions can reference them
- version request schemas or RPC names when compatibility cannot be preserved

Use a new routing flag or Attribute so only new executions enter an incompatible path.

## Review checklist

- Can the graph explain every success, wait, failure, cancellation, and timeout path?
- Are Step inputs and transitions typed?
- Are side effects idempotent under retry?
- Does each Channel have one clear producer/consumer contract?
- Are shared state changes protected when concurrent Steps or RPCs can race?
- Is fan-out bounded?
- Can an operator identify the current business state from Dex Web or dexcli?
