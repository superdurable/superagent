Read only the sections relevant to the task.

## Flow

Use a Flow as the top-level durable business execution. It owns the Step list, persistence schema, and RPC handlers. Give the Flow type and execution ID stable business meanings.

Docs: https://docs.superdurable.io/primitives/flow

## Step and Wait

Use a Step for retried background work and explicit state transitions. **WaitFor** returns Conditions; **Execute** performs work and returns a Step decision.

Leave Conditions unnamed in **Until**, **AnyOf**, and **AllOf**. Do not add condition IDs merely to distinguish branches: read Channel results from the Channel definition and inspect Timer outcomes through the Context. Every Condition in **AnyCombinationOf** needs a unique ID. A Timer also needs an ID when another operation selects it by ID, such as **SkipTimer**.

Use multiple next Steps for parallel work. Use cancellation deliberately when a first-winner branch makes siblings unnecessary.

Step durability resolves in this order: a method override, FlowConfig, then **SYNC**. The default retry total duration is four hours. Regular attempts default to a two-hour method timeout and one-minute heartbeat timeout.

A long-running regular attempt must emit an explicit heartbeat or Stream message before its heartbeat timeout. A heartbeat value is a retry checkpoint. An explicit valueless heartbeat clears the checkpoint; a Stream message preserves its current state. The local phase of **ASYNC** durability ignores heartbeats but still emits Stream messages.

For an LLM call that may remain healthy without output for more than one minute, tell the application developer to raise **HeartbeatTimeout** above its one-minute default. Size it to the longest acceptable silent interval, and use the method timeout to cap the whole attempt. Do not add periodic heartbeats solely to mask provider silence; they prove only that application code is running, not that the upstream request is progressing.

## Attribute

Use an Attribute for durable state inside one Flow execution. Register every Attribute in the persistence schema before reading or writing it.

Use one Attribute when the value is cohesive and should be replaced as a unit. Use an AttributeMap when runtime-keyed instances change independently; each instance is stored separately, avoiding a rewrite of the whole collection. Use stable domain keys and delete instances that are no longer needed.

RPCs receive regular Attribute values automatically. They must explicitly load AttributeMap entries. Load the whole map for broad snapshots or exact instances for known keys. AttributeMap size does not make its entries available. An explicit load controls data transfer only; it does not enable transactional execution or isolation.

Lock the exact AttributeMap instance when Steps or RPCs can race on it. Do not treat an AttributeMap index as an index over its instances: all instances share one Flow search field, later writes replace that field, and instance keys are not searchable. AttributeMap enumeration is not server-side pagination.

Read [large-attributes-and-locality.md](large-attributes-and-locality.md) for large values, map chunking, BlobCache locality, and external projections.

## Channel

Use a Channel for ordered, durable, typed messages scoped to one Flow execution. One matching wait consumes a message once.

Use a ChannelMap when the same message contract is partitioned by a dynamic key. Plan how externally published messages are drained before Flow completion.

Every pending Channel message has a server-assigned message ID. List pending messages when an application needs a durable queue UI. Listing preserves FIFO order and does not consume messages. Only a pending message can be deleted; deletion after consumption returns the Channel-message-not-found error.

RPCs always receive ChannelInfo sizes, so Channel size and ChannelMap keys and sizes do not require a load. Reading pending message envelopes requires an explicit Channel or ChannelMap load. Load the whole ChannelMap or exact instances according to what the handler reads. A loaded empty queue is empty; reading an unloaded queue is a usage error.

A Channel queue is not conversation history. Keep consumed user and assistant messages in Attributes when the application must display or reconstruct them.

Use a transactional RPC to move or edit a pending message atomically. The caller should send only the message ID. Explicitly load the source Channel, find the original Value in the RPC snapshot, then stage its deletion and destination publication. A missing message rejects the entire transaction, including all Attribute writes and Channel publications.

Attribute locking already selects transactional execution. Channel deletion without an Attribute lock must explicitly select the SDK's transactional RPC option. Transactional validation protects an ID-only move from concurrent consumption, but it does not isolate decisions based on the whole snapshot. For those decisions, every cooperating Step and RPC writer must use the same Attribute lock. The lock does not implicitly load map entries or Channel messages.

Without transactional execution, a signal RPC treats a missing deletion as a no-op and commits its other effects. Cadence implements the operation as query followed by signal and cannot provide the same atomic guarantee.

## RPC

Use an RPC for a typed request/response interaction with an active Flow. RPC handlers may read or update Attributes and publish Channels. Protect shared mutations with Attribute locks when they can race with Steps or other RPCs.

Use a Channel instead when the caller should enqueue work without synchronous application-level handling.

Keep application read models cohesive. When one page needs conversation Attributes, a description, and pending queues, prefer one read-only snapshot RPC that explicitly loads those collections over several independently timed requests.

Select transactional execution when an RPC must atomically validate a pending Channel message ID and commit its deletion with other Flow-state writes. Handle the Channel-message-not-found error as a stale queue view and refresh before retrying.

Docs: https://docs.superdurable.io/primitives/rpc

## Stream

Use a Stream for low-latency, best-effort, resumable updates such as progress displayed in a UI. Do not use a Stream when delivery must be durable; use a Channel or Attribute instead.

A Step may append any number of messages to the same or different Streams before its final result. A Step Stream write is fire-and-forget: local encoding or registration can fail immediately, but Dex Server does not acknowledge Stream Store persistence and a Store failure does not fail the Step.

When a Step calls a streaming LLM API, create one invocation-managed buffered text writer before starting the request and pass its bound write method as the token or delta callback. Do not call direct Stream write for each LLM token or delta. The default one-second timer and 16 KiB soft UTF-8 threshold reduce message volume, and the invocation flushes the tail before its result or error. In Go, Java, Python async, TypeScript, and Rust, call only write; the SDK owns finalization. Python sync generators are cooperative and must yield from an explicit final flush. An empty buffer does not heartbeat. Retry does not restore unsent text and may repeat batches already sent.

Use the text-specific API for the installed SDK version: **NewBufferedTextStream** in Go, **BufferedTextStream.create** in Java, **buffered_text** in Python, **bufferedText** in TypeScript, or **buffered_text** in Rust. For example, a Python async Step should create **progress = thinking.buffered_text(context)** and pass **progress.write** to the LLM helper.

Continue using direct Stream writes for semantically complete, independent messages. Do not buffer events merely because they arrive quickly; batching changes the message boundaries observed by readers.

Step messages use **#StepExecutionID** as source metadata. The source is not an idempotency key: attempts and messages may share it, and every write appends. Client Stream writes require a nonempty source, which may repeat or contain **#**.

## Timer

Use a Timer Condition for a durable delay, reminder, deadline branch, or scheduling loop. Decide what happens if a timer is skipped and whether the business deadline should complete, cancel, fail, or route to a handler.

Docs: https://docs.superdurable.io/primitives/timer

## SubFlow

Use a SubFlow for child work that benefits from a separate Flow identity and lifecycle. Bound parallel SubFlows and define their reuse, cancellation, and parent-completion behavior.

Docs: https://docs.superdurable.io/primitives/subflow

## Client

Use the Client at application boundaries to start, stop, inspect, search, and interact with Flows. Handle typed SDK failures for duplicate starts, missing Flows, closed Flows, long-poll expiry, and uncompleted closure.
