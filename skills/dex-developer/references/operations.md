# Testing, diagnosis, and operations

## Test the durable behavior

Prefer integration tests for behavior involving Dex Server, a Worker, a Client, waiting, retry, persistence, or RPCs. Useful scenarios include:

- start the Flow and verify its terminal output
- publish a Channel message and verify the waiting Step advances
- invoke an RPC and verify its response and durable state change
- verify a Timer branch without relying on a fixed sleep
- force a retryable failure and verify retry or exhausted-retry routing
- verify duplicate start behavior with a stable request or Flow ID
- restart or replace a Worker and verify an open Flow continues
- verify concurrent Step or RPC updates preserve locked invariants
- verify terminal Flows reject interactions that require an active Flow

Use unique Flow IDs per test. Poll with a deadline for asynchronous convergence. Keep the Dex environment isolated or cleanly namespaced.

## Diagnostic order

1. Capture the exact Flow ID, run ID, Flow type, SDK version, and Dex Server address.
2. Check Worker application logs for handler and connectivity errors.
3. Inspect the Flow in Dex Web.
4. Run a bounded read-only inspection:

```bash
dexcli flow inspect <flow-id> --all-history
```

5. Compare the active Step, Attributes, Channel waits, Timers, and recent semantic events with the intended graph.
6. Reproduce with the smallest matching integration test.
7. Fix application code or configuration, then decide whether existing executions need recovery.

## Inspect pending Channel messages

List a Channel's pending messages to obtain the current FIFO values and server-assigned IDs. An ID disappears once its message is consumed or deleted. If delete or transactional move returns Channel-message-not-found, treat the local view as stale, reload the queue, and let the user choose again.

Only pending Channel state is mutable through these operations. Editing a message means deleting it successfully and publishing a replacement with a new ID; it does not rewrite Flow history or application conversation Attributes.

Use a transactional RPC when deletion must commit atomically with a replacement publication or other Flow-state writes. Signal RPC deletion is best-effort when the ID is missing. Cadence uses query plus signal and retains a race between validation and mutation, so applications must reconcile from a fresh list.

Use **dexcli flow search**, **summary**, **state**, and **history** for narrower JSON output. Use **--no-hydrate** when payload contents are unnecessary or sensitive.

## Common failure classes

- Worker unavailable: verify bind address, advertised target, network path, and process health.
- Unknown Flow or Step type: verify registry contents and deployment version.
- Attribute or Channel rejected: verify the persistence schema and exact stable name.
- Flow does not advance: inspect the active Step's Conditions and pending Channel/Timer state.
- Repeated side effect: make **Execute** idempotent and align retry policy with the external API.
- Closed Flow interaction: handle the SDK's typed not-active error at the application boundary.
- Large payload failure: verify Worker and Client blob/payload configuration matches.
- Incompatible deployment: restore the required Step type or fix forward with a new compatible path.

## Safe recovery

Diagnosis is read-only by default. Stop, time travel, publish, invoke, skip a Timer, or mutate Attributes only when the user asks to change the Flow.

Before a mutation:

- resolve the current exact run
- explain the expected state change
- use the public Client or dexcli operation
- satisfy any explicit confirmation flag
- re-inspect the Flow afterward

Time travel is appropriate after deploying a code fix when replaying from a safe Step boundary will not duplicate an unprotected side effect. If that cannot be established, design an explicit recovery or compensation Step instead.

When a durable-history bug has already failed a Flow, validate the fix against that
same history when safe:

1. Deploy or restart the Worker with the corrected code.
2. Time travel the failed Flow to the last safe execution before the failure.
3. Let Dex replay and continue with the corrected Worker.
4. Re-inspect the new run and verify the formerly failing path and durable state.

This is stronger than testing only a new Flow because it exercises recovery from the
actual recorded history. Do not cross an external side effect unless it is idempotent,
compensated, or explicitly safe to repeat.

## Deployment changes

Open Flows can continue after new Worker code is deployed. Before removing or changing a durable contract, search for open executions that may still reference it. Keep old Step types and schemas available until those executions finish or are deliberately migrated.
